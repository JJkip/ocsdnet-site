		The Modern Language Association achieved a major goal with the launch of MLA Commons, built on CBOX, in January 2013. Our members are using the network's user-friendly features to develop new collaborations, to discuss professional issues, and to share their in-process work. The Commons has also provided us with a platform for a range of experiments in new forms of open scholarly publishing. We're grateful for the generosity of the CUNY Graduate Center in its development of and support for CBOX, and we look forward to working with the team on the project's future.

Commons In A Box  made it possible for us to get the Project Hieroglyph community site built quickly with all kinds of useful features that will scale with the project. I was relieved to have a set of plugins that I knew would be maintained and improved as the years went on. There is nothing sadder than finding the perfect plugin solution only to realize it had been abandoned by developers years ago. Knowing that there is a whole community behind CBOX, BuddyPress and Wordpress gives me peace of mind as a site manager that I will never troubleshoot alone.

		I ran my undergraduate digital humanities course out of Commons In A Box and turned the class into a community. The plugin was easy to install, set up, and customize, and it worked so well that I'm now using it to run a social network for our English majors. It's Facebook for grown-ups: a space for truly productive conversation and collaboration.

CBOX transforms BuddyPress into a complete social network by making all the difficult decisions about which additional plugins to install. The community is helpful, the documentation is thorough, the code is clear and the developers are responsive, all of which makes the process of developing sites based on CBOX a pleasure.

Commons-in-a-Box has provided the Bernard L. Schwartz Communication
Institute with a robust tool for internal communication and an easy
process for building institutional memory across its wide range of
programming. That CBox is stable and in constant development means we
have a sustainable tool to present our work to the public. In short,
CBox rules, and the more institutions of higher education that deploy
it, the stronger university life will be.

When we started exploring technology options for Project Hieroglyph, Commons In A Box immediately stood out for its  flexibility and ease of use. We knew we needed a toolkit open and expandable enough to replace the previous collaborative space science fiction author Neal Stephenson and some of our other participants were used to: a big room with whiteboards and swords in it. Commons In A Box  combines the best of WordPress's stability, extensibility and community focus with a can-do digital humanities flair.
