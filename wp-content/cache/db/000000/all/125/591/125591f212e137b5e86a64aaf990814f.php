<strong><strong>¬†</strong></strong>I think that open research is important for a number of reasons: You can have more people actively involved in the research process. You can get the public involved. You democratize research and level the playing field. If you open the process up you can do better science, faster. Open research has no geographical boundaries and allows you to work with everybody, which is incredibly liberating. Currently, the playing field is not level and there are big issues of resources, lack of awareness, differences in traditions and working practices, all of which may inhibit people from working together. If we really want to try and make the science meritocratic, then we have to make an effort to make sure everyone can be involved. Hopefully, the projects that are put forward by the OCSDNet will be proactive in making sure that people who are in less resourced environments are able to take part or lead. I think that if we can run effective projects and if we can combine the projects with some reflection so as to learn from them then there is a real chance to create lessons for how more people can get involved in future projects.

Allow me to relate to this on a personal level. About 10 years ago I gave a talk at the University of Yaound√©, Cameroon. I thought that it would be great to establish a project where students in my lab and in Cameroon could work together using the internet as a collaborative medium. It was a perfectly fine idea, but the problem is a lack of basic resources: an un-level playing field. There were just so many things that were preventing people from getting involved and that was immensely restraining. I think to examine those things- why people can‚Äôt participate or ways in which people can - is really important for the next generation of students who are learning in these countries. If we can understand the problems then maybe we can fix them. If we can do that then people have the ability to collaborate on research projects in detail and in real time.

<strong><strong>¬†</strong></strong>My background is in organic chemistry, which is an important part of the drug discovery and development process. A while back we did a project on improving a drug called praziquantel (PZQ), which is used to treat bilharzia [schistosomiasis] around the world. We were working on this with the World Health Organization to make this drug more active and less bitter, which is important for mass distribution programs. We did the project open source, which was a first. We put the problem out on the web and then worked on it in full public view so that our lab notebooks and all our ideas were shared and we allowed anyone to participate in the project. We got a lot of help from outside the core team, particularly from companies who helped to solve the problem much faster than had we done it on our own. That led to another project, which I am now working on with the<a href="http://www.mmv.org/"> Medicines for Malaria Venture</a>, called<a href="http://opensourcemalaria.org/"> Open Source Malaria (OSM)</a>. It‚Äôs a consortium of people who are working together completely openly with no secrecy to find new medicine for malaria that could be effective in treating this terrible disease. I should say that is now leading to a more general idea called<a href="http://www.opensourcepharma.net/"> Open Source Pharma</a>: the idea that you could apply radical openness to the whole drug discovery process and take something from discovery all the way to the clinic without any secrecy at all.

<strong><strong>¬†</strong></strong>I bring this experience of working in an open way on actual science projects. Most of the time is spent actually doing the science but we do have to spend time figuring out how to work in this way. There are different challenges when you have no walls around your project.
<ol start="3">
	<li><b>How do you think that your own work will benefit from being involved with OCSDNet</b>?</li>
</ol>
Being open allows you to involve both patients and researchers from endemic countries. One of the reasons to get involved in OCSDNet is to try and work out why it is that we are not very good at involving labs and students from endemic areas. I‚Äôd like to know that. I‚Äôd like to know more about the barriers and how we can involve people more effectively from countries that, so far, have not been involved in OSM. If students from any country could start contributing to the detail of the science because it‚Äôs all completely openly available online, it would be amazingly productive for everybody. Amazing in terms of the science, amazing in terms of the students from better-resourced environments and amazing for the students in less resourced environments because they might gain access to resources with minimal expense. It‚Äôs a win for everybody, but we have got to make sure that we are doing it right.

	<li><b></b> <b>Why are you interested in supporting OCSDNet?</b></li>
</ol>
I became interested in supporting the OCSDNet because I think it is an attractive endeavor. It‚Äôs one that invites a broad variety of reflection and analysis of the issues that are of clear concern to me. Among them is the private and public question. There is a hidden meaning associated with the word ‚Äúopen‚Äù, because of the assumption that science before was not really open and there were different barriers. We know there always have been barriers. But is ‚Äúopen‚Äù science surely so open? Can‚Äôt we think of open science without necessarily having to consider the technological gadgets usually associated with it? So, this notion is really intriguing and fascinating: the emphasis on social actors, actions, strategies, motivations; the interest of institutional and social constraints; the possibility of overcoming those constraints; richness of thinking, knowledge sharing, networking activities. It‚Äôs not something that comes from the top down. It‚Äôs the grassroots who are actually doing the research.

Science is increasingly a collective endeavor and we tend to forget about that. I‚Äôm rather interested in the possibility of collaborative science amongst individuals motivated by curiosity, by the idea of sharing knowledge, insights and intuitions. I wish to understand and explore the principles and dynamics of collaboration unencumbered by dominant top-down categorizations, hierarchies, disciplinary authority structures; to analyze the conditions enabling research that may contribute to produce more universal science in a more equitable, global society. I am no longer convinced that development goals in the Global South are independent of what happens to science in general. I believe that open, collaborative science would be a way to transform science in society as a whole, not just to solve the problems of the Global South.
<ol start="2">
	<li><b></b> <b>What skills, insights and experiences do you bring to this initiative?</b></li>
</ol>
Well, I am a social scientist, and a social anthropologist by training. I have always been interested in the human aspiration to share equally, despite the continuous production and reproduction of inequalities and secrecy in the world.

I have done research in many different contexts on issues dealing with inequality and hierarchy, respect and disrespect, private/public boundaries in science, and science publishing and evaluation. I have found myself in places where cooperation ¬†programs were created and assessed. I hope to be helpful to this discussion of infrastructural transformation in scientific research, the assessment of different schemes, and perhaps policy recommendations. I think that I may be helpful with regards to considerations about the system rather than the technologies to be used. This is a collective enterprise, and I am going to learn a lot.
<ol start="3">
	<li><b></b> ¬†¬†¬†¬†<b>How do you think that your own work will benefit from being involved with OCSDNet?</b></li>
</ol>
I think that I will benefit greatly from this initiative, because it is a learning experience for all. Perhaps this is the idea. Being from the South, I can learn together with others that also come from the Global South and well-meaning people from the Global North about these new tools and arrangements. I like to see open, collaborative science as a complex socio-technological system that is much more than a collection of mechanisms like open source, open access, open educational resources, and open data.

I am concerned with the unintended outcomes and potentially negative impacts brought about by such open practices and network design. I think I would also like to explore more the institutional infrastructure that would enable a future science that would be much more collaborative without fragmentation between Global North and Global South. This is an initiative for the Global South, which is good because in the end we‚Äôre always being forgotten, but still it cannot be a solution only for the Global South because otherwise it‚Äôs not going to be a solution at all. I‚Äôm exploring the question of what is the state of open science, particularly that of open social science in the world at large, not just in the Global South. So given the new platforms and arrangements, I‚Äôm curious in the tracking of usage and impact based on different frameworks that are found in different locations. There are people that I work with and their work is invisible. I hope that I‚Äôll be able to end up knowing better or understanding what is involved in this.

	<li><b>¬† ¬†¬†</b> <b>Why are you interested in supporting the OCSDNet?</b></li>
</ol>
I believe that fundamentally knowledge should be open. That‚Äôs the bottom line for promoting development. This belief started a while ago when I was working on my doctoral dissertation on technological standards. I examined how latecomer countries and firms caught up technologically and economically with the forerunners. I realized that the field of technological development and policy had focused primarily on knowledge in the proprietary regime. Countries and companies try to dominate the knowledge industry and to make profit from the proprietary knowledge that they have created. Although such an approach has helped create numerous innovations, so much knowledge is never distributed widely so that it helps improve the livelihoods of the poor and disadvantaged. Most of the time, people who end up benefitting from the proprietary knowledge regime are those who already have better access to the knowledge in the first place. So, I feel that there is still much to do, so that the global system of knowledge production can really benefit the disadvantaged in the society. I‚Äôd like to support the OCSDNet initiative so that we can help create more open knowledge that will contribute to the livelihoods of the people who need it the most.

&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
	<li><b></b> ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† <b>What skills, insights and experiences do you bring to this initiative?</b></li>
</ol>
For my research and advocacy work in the past few years, I try to combine two areas of expertise: innovation and technology studies and urban studies. In the context of developing countries where rapid urbanization is accompanied by a large number of urban problems, I feel that technologies and innovations have to be brought down from the national level to the local and community levels and have to be more inclusive. To me, innovations are not just new products, services, and processes that are usually for-profit and bought and sold in the marketplace. We need to consider and promote socially- and sustainability-oriented innovations as well, especially in the context of development. ¬†For instance, there are a lot of innovations that are created in the urban informal sector and not by hi-tech startups or large conglomerates. And yet, they contribute greatly to improving the livelihoods of the people on the ground.

I hope that my knowledge in the two fields and the experience from working at the policy and grassroots levels could help facilitate the links between researchers in the upstream stage of knowledge production and those in the downstream stage, who create, implement, and scale up innovations. I‚Äôve been working with governments, NGOs, civic groups, and foundations in the past few years to promote innovations that are open and aimed at promoting inclusive development. I have learned that socio-economic, political, and cultural issues are critical to turning open knowledge into open and inclusive innovations and scaling them up. So I hope I can contribute to the project by helping with the grantees in disentangling the complex factors that would affect their efforts to implement and scale-up their ideas.

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
	<li><b></b> ¬†¬†¬†¬†<b>How do you think that your own work will benefit from being involved with OCSDNet?</b></li>
</ol>
Even though I know a bit about the downstream part of the knowledge value chain, there is still much more to learn. I‚Äôd like to be connected with and learn more from other people who are involved actively in the upstream stage of knowledge production. Hopefully linking with people from different continents will also help with my own work, which has been primarily focusing on Southeast Asia. By linking with African and South American colleagues, I hope to expand my academic and professional networks. I believe the open regime of knowledge production will help us learn from commonalities and differences across countries and continents, and eventually figure out what and how technical and institutional solutions could help solve problems that the disadvantaged people in our societies are facing today.

	<li><b></b> <b>Why are you interested in participating and supporting the OCSDNet?</b></li>
</ol>
For me the point of open science, open access, open data -all of those things- is to provide opportunities for people to engage, interact and contribute to research and scholarship more generally. There has been no bigger gap in engagement and in particular, contribution to research than that between the countries in the Global North and those countries spending less on research or perhaps having less research capacity for historical reasons. So for me, this is part of a broader agenda to engage as many people as possible in research and scholarship. The contributions and perspectives, information, time and energy that they bring can really only help contribute to the progress of research more generally.
<ol start="2">
	<li><b></b> <b>What skills, insights and experiences do you bring to this initiative?</b></li>
</ol>
I have a background in open science and open data and actually came into this space from an open data perspective as a researcher when I was at the University of Southampton working on molecular biology. So I‚Äôve had experience trying to do different kinds of open science: sharing notebooks, publishing in the open, making data available with some success and some failures along the way. I have some understanding of what works and what doesn‚Äôt work in that context.

More recently, I‚Äôve really come to understand how little I know about research outside the context of North America, Europe and the UK in particular. So, I think I have learnt the lesson that the important thing is to listen and to offer advice where people have already decided what‚Äôs important to them. I think that‚Äôs sort of the experience I‚Äôve had working on a couple of projects with various people, some to do with South America, and some to do with Africa, such as the<a href="http://www.scaprogramme.org.za/"> Scholarly Communication in Africa Programme</a>. I came to the conclusion that I didn‚Äôt really understand what was going on so while I might have some expertise and some experience, the first step is really understanding what it is that people need and want to achieve in their own context rather than saying ‚Äúthis is the way forward‚Äù.
<ol start="3">
	<li><b></b> <b>How do you think your own work will benefit from being involved in the network?</b></li>
</ol>
From my perspective, my own work will benefit from understanding more about what people‚Äôs needs and desires are in developing and transitional countries in terms of research. So, understanding more of what the challenges are, what the opportunities are and being able to bring that to the tools and systems that I‚Äôm involved in. At <a href="http://www.plos.org/">PLOS</a>, we‚Äôre trying to ensure that we‚Äôre doing the right kinds of things to support this large and growing group of researchers and scholars who represent a huge resource of expertise, knowledge, energy, and experience, and particularly knowledge of the problems that matter in their particular context.

One of the problems we have in research communication is that we‚Äôve built this entire system that is focused on rewarding people for focusing on the problems of a pretty limited proportion of the world‚Äôs population. So, figuring out how we can start to move that so that problems that are relevant in development contexts are seen as prestigious problems to tackle, and that the people with experience and expertise in those problems really have enormous resources to bring to solving those problems. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôd like to see this going. That way, we can start to change, modify or tilt the research system as a whole so as to rebalance it towards to the other 85% of the world‚Äôs population.

One thing that is interesting to probe is to try and understand what form resources are in development contexts. So I‚Äôm coming from a perspective of open access. And the challenge with open access and the research literature is that it costs money to make the research literature due to quality assurance and management. And we can work to bring that cost down, but its not going to go away. So it would be a terrible thing to take away the barriers for scholars without resources to be able to read the literature but place barriers for them to be able to write to the scholarly literature. So, we need to think about rebalancing the system in a way that allows people to contribute.

	<li><b> ¬†¬†Why are you interested in supporting OCSDNet?</b></li>
</ol>
I think that when we talk about open and collaborative science for development it‚Äôs really a very important movement. More than ever, scientific communities have to work together in order to address the development challenges that are beyond their own borders. There are regional, there are even global challenges. And if you can use the most open kind of science production, the better we can really bring solutions to development challenges.

I also believe that open and collaborative science is also a way of promoting more young researchers. That‚Äôs how young people work, that‚Äôs how they are educated nowadays. They have their own networks. It is a way also to really produce knowledge jointly that is probably very relevant for the younger generation of researchers. So again, I think it could be a very important network and one that really we need to have, so I‚Äôm very happy to be part of this initiative.
<ol start="2">
	<li><b></b> <b>What skills, insights and experiences do you bring to this initiative?</b></li>
</ol>
I have worked a lot on public policies; in ICT-related policies and also in science-related policies, and also development policies. ¬†So, I think I can bring quite a good knowledge base on these kinds of public policies that of course will be relevant once our network can function.

One of the areas this network focuses on is¬†Africa. I am a Mozambican citizen. I know Africa very well. I have quite a few networks there, and I think I can also bring an understanding of the challenges that the continent is facing, as well as the networks of researchers and of policymakers that can be part of this and that can benefit from a program like this one.

Also by being in UNESCO. UNESCO‚Äôs work is to promote these kinds of initiatives, to make sure that scientific production is really promoted and taking place. We have UNESCO's network too, and I think that‚Äôs also something that I can bring to the table. But, I am also interested in trying to reflect jointly with others as to how can we promote an initiative like this.

	<li><b> ¬†¬†How do you think that your own work will benefit from being involved with OCSDNet?</b></li>
</ol>
One of the areas that UNESCO is very interested in is how to promote the production of scientific knowledge everywhere in the world, and in particular in the South, and in South-South cooperation. Guaranteeing that there is scientific capacity everywhere in the world is part of the mandate and one of the objectives of UNESCO. So by being part of this initiative I think I will learn a lot: how open and collaborative science can not only bring more answers to some of the development challenges we are facing, but also how it will create scientific capacity. And those are things that definitely I will learn a lot from. And that will have a direct impact in what we do here at UNESCO.

It will be interesting too -particularly because now I‚Äôm in the Latin American region- I might see a program like this in the future for the Latin American region and the Caribbean, where UNESCO could also become a partner. So, I‚Äôm looking forward to this experience.

<blockquote>There was a little girl who was told by her grandpa the stories of a Wild Hyena who used to visit their neighbourhood in their rural village. ¬†The girl imagined a new Hyena face for every story. ¬†It was only when she saw the Hyena, 20 years later, that she was able to see the real face of the animal and understand the passion and the meaning of her grandpa's stories. So if a picture is worth a thousand words, a real-true value is worth one year of a social campaign.

<strong><strong>¬†</strong></strong>The workshop that Leslie and his team prepared was real in the discussion, exchange of thoughts, people, and action plans. It made me understand the concept note I wrote myself, better, after attending the workshop. This, with no doubt, puts a higher responsibility on us to make sure this new movement of ‚ÄúOpen, Collaboration, Science for Development" vibrates in our respective communities as rich and as diverse as they are.

<strong><strong>¬†</strong></strong>Finding two people able to communicate well even if they do not speak the same language is much easier than asking 2 ‚Äúscholars‚Äù from different schools of thought (let alone 25 of them who speak a common language) to agree.

But, just because the workshop is about ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù, ‚ÄúCollaboration‚Äù, ‚ÄúScience‚Äùand ‚ÄúDevelopment‚Äù, we were ready to accept our differences and get engaged in challenging discussions. ¬†After all, our commonality does not stem from our respective disciplines but rather from our beliefs in the path of participation and openness.

Contrary to many meetings I attended where I am usually able to catch upon my readings, in this workshop, all sessions were interesting and mentally engaging that I willingly gave up on my original plan. ¬†Of course we owe this to the hard work and creativity of the organisers.

<strong><strong>¬†</strong></strong>

I would like to end with 2 ‚ÄúOutcomes‚Äù and 1 ‚ÄúImpact‚Äù:
<ol>
	<li>Learnt to appreciate and try to understand some of the work undertaken by Social Scientists and because the ideologies brought up by some of the colleagues were so interesting that I had to apologise for Pablo for daring as a chemist to join the network.</li>
	<li>Met really wonderful colleagues.</li>
	<li>I am grateful to be part of this network and think that, together, we are on to ‚Äúsomething‚Äù.</li>

<blockquote>&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I am coming from Costa Rica and I am very happy to be here with you tonight in Nairobi - a city I have yet to discover in the next few days, although I already had a good glimpse of the friendly and welcoming character of the people of Kenya.

I work in the field of natural resources management, and one thing that strikes me about knowledge as a resource, is that it does not deplete from using it; rather the opposite: knowledge tends to grow when shared. And science is also knowledge. During this fruitful 3-day workshop, I had the chance to share a lot, and to learn a lot. Beyond my own project I have grown myself thanks to the 13 other very diverse proposals that were presented.

I am always amazed at how diversity is such a great thing. We came from many different countries, many different horizons, with diverse ideas, perspectives, challenges. and still, I feel we have more things in common than differences. That may be because we all have a shared vision, which is creating a collaborative culture in the Global South through open science, with one major goal: fostering development in our countries.

For bringing us together here, I would like to thank the whole OCSDNet team, including iHub. I know it was a nightmare in terms of logistics, but to me it was like a dream! So thank you Leslie, Angela, Nanjira, Abby, Rosemary, Joe, Kelvin, Samuel, and also Ellie from IDRC.

<strong><strong>¬†</strong></strong>This very well-designed workshop helped to make this newly-born network much more real. In our globalized, virtual world, nothing can always completely replace face-to-face human interactions. I believe knowing each other will also help us make this network grow in the future. I am very excited to be part of it, and I will return to Costa Rica with a lot of inspiration in my mind and my suitcase.</blockquote>";s:10:"post_title";s:67:"Reflections from Josique Lorenzo, on the concluded OCSDNet Workshop";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:66:"reflections-from-josique-lorenzo-on-the-concluded-ocsdnet-workshop";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-10-23 09:18:11";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-10-23 09:18:11";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:25:"http://ocsdnet.org/?p=312";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:8;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"318";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"3";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2014-10-23 18:30:46";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2014-10-23 18:30:46";s:12:"post_content";s:3636:"After a highly competitive selection process, the OCSDNet Advisors and Coordinating Team convened with 14 short-listed applicants for the OCSDNet Proposal Development Workshop in Nairobi, Kenya from October 13th-15th. This diverse group of applicants represent a range of disciplinary backgrounds and perspectives on Open and Collaborative Science (OCS) from Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, Middle East and Asia.

<strong><strong>¬†</strong></strong>

Workshop activities were designed based on the principles and practices of openness. As such, applicants engaged in a series of interactive exercises that encouraged reflection on the common goals, approaches and principles of OCS. The highlights of the program included applicant presentations on their respective proposed projects; peer-to-peer commentary and critique of concept notes; group discussions that critically unpacked the concepts of ‚Äúopen‚Äù, ‚Äúcollaborative‚Äù, ‚Äúscience‚Äù and ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù; and considerations regarding final proposal submissions.

<strong><strong>¬†</strong></strong>

The workshop concluded with the official OCSDNet Launch, hosted at the iHub. The Launch was a well-attended event, and remarks were shared by Leslie Chan, representatives from the <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/">IDRC</a>, as well as by two project applicants: Najat Saliba and Josique Lorenzo. Najat and Josique‚Äôs remarks are available <a href="http://ocsdnet.org/category/ocsdnet-workshop/">here</a>.

<strong><strong>¬†</strong></strong>

Over the next several weeks, the workshop participants will be reconvening with their research collaborators/teams to develop full project proposal submissions. Unlike traditional research application procedures, the OCSDNet Coordinating Team will be translating OCS principles into practice by encouraging applicants to engage with one another‚Äôs proposals by providing feedback and critique. The advisors will also play a supportive role in this process by providing commentary. Complete project proposals are due on November 30th, for a final review process, following which we will announce the grantees and the projects proposed.

<strong><strong>¬†</strong></strong>

Short video interviews with each of the participants briefly explaining their OCS concept proposals will soon be shared. In the meantime, check out our <a href="https://storify.com/OCSDNet/ocsdnet-convening-in-nairobi">Storify post</a> on the workshop and launch.

How do we increase access of knowledge resources for grassroots communities? Is it ethical on the part of researchers to collect information from individual/community knowledge holders and never communicate back their research results to the original knowledge providers? What kinds of knowledge resources should be shared back to the grassroots communities and how can we share them optimally? Are the current intellectual property laws and policies promoting such an open and democratic knowledge sharing process? Or are they treating grassroots knowledge communities only as consumers of information and not as producers of information? What kind of innovative legal and/ or policy measures can enable more equitable knowledge sharing and development outcomes based on shared knowledge resources? How do we evolve more open and collaborative science approaches? What are the different open and democratic approaches that can enable an inclusive knowledge movement for sustainable development outcomes across the globe?

These are some of the questions we would like to explore together as part of a panel discussion at the <strong>Third International Conference on Creativity at Grassroots (ICCIG3) at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA), India, January 19-22, 2015.</strong> As some of the knowledge movements in different parts of the world have already highlighted, there has been a serious neglect in communicating back value added knowledge to the original knowledge providers. Even worse, many of us are still trapped in the limited benefits of individual monopoly of knowledge resources and failing to see the wider benefits of collaborative science. Through a more equitable, open and democratic sharing of knowledge resources, supported by the developments in digital technologies for communication, we may see far more development outcomes across the globe. Through this panel discussion, we aim to contribute to the global open and collaborative science movement, by <em>highlighting the best practices and optimal legal/ policy changes for enabling such an inclusive knowledge movement.</em> We would be particularly interested in hearing from policy makers, activists, academicians, lawyers and students from different fields of studies and different countries.
