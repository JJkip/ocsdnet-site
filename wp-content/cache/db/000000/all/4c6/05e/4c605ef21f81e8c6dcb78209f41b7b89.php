<h2>OCSDNET APPLICATION</h2>
</div>
<div class="article-content">
<h4 dir="ltr">2014¬†applications.</h4>
<h4 dir="ltr">Summary:</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Individual researchers and organizations based in all parts of the developing regions of the world can, in principle, can qualify for support</strong>. Applications, in the form of a<a href="http://ocsdnet.org/downloads/OCSDNetCallforConceptPapers.pdf" target="_blank">Concept Note</a>, should centre on case studies that employ innovative and transformative open processes in generating knowledge and actions intended to address a range of development challenges in various Global South contexts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It will be a two-stage application process: successful concept notes‚Äô applicants will be invited to attend a proposal development workshop in Nairobi, and full final proposal is expected on November 30th, 2014.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Number of grants ‚Äì <strong>Up to 15 grants will be awarded</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Amount of the grants ‚Äì <strong>Research or implementation projects up to $80,000 CAD each</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Online Application Submission Portal ‚Äì <strong>opens August 18, 2014</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Online Call for Concept Note Submissions Closed ‚Äì <strong>September 8, 2014</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Short-listed Concept Notes Notified ‚Äì <strong>September 24, 2014</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Mandatory Workshop in Nairobi ‚Äì <strong>October 13 ‚Äì 15, 2014</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Due date of final proposal ‚Äì <strong>Nov. 17th, 2014</strong></p>

<h4 dir="ltr">Purpose of the Call</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Open and collaborative approaches to knowledge production have the potential to radically increase the visibility, validation and relevance of scientific research, while expanding the opportunities for a broad range of actors to participate in the knowledge production process. However, little research has been conducted into these asserted benefits and in the contexts in which they might be realised. <strong>How is ‚Äúopenness‚Äù practiced by researchers in various institutional contexts? How can open science approaches benefit researchers in the Global South? Can greater participation of citizens in the planning and conduct of scientific research increase its usefulness in addressing local development goals? How can the sharing of knowledge as a public good be weighed against protection of various forms of rights?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">To begin to answer these and related questions, we are inviting applications on case studies that employ innovative and transformative open processes in generating knowledge and actions intended to address a range of development challenges in various Global South contexts (e.g. food security, health equity, citizen empowerment, and climate change related impact). We expect that funding of these case studies will strengthen the empirical foundation on the diversity of Open and Collaborative Science (OCS) practices as well as knowledge on their common principles, actors, motivations, and their institutional contexts. In particular, the project is interested in exploring whether OCS could subsequently lead to innovative models of redistribution of access to knowledge, economic opportunities, social justice, individual freedom, and well-being, and the conditions that lead to both positive, negative and unanticipated outcomes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>We welcome a mix of projects that include scientific research in a specific domain aimed at producing new knowledge, as well as critical research on ongoing initiatives, focusing on the behaviours, contexts, challenges and opportunities enabled by OCS.</strong> The longer term goal is to construct a conceptual framework on how open science norms and practices could be further established in developing countries via a community-based and networked driven approach, while building on key lessons learned from the funded case studies as well as existing related Open initiatives. As such, OCSDNet is expected to be a highly cross-disciplinary community of practice, engaging in partnership building with like-minded organizations, both locally and internationally.</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">Modality of the Call</h4>
<p dir="ltr">OCSDNet is jointly coordinated by <a href="http://www.ihub.co.ke/">iHub</a> (Kenya) and Leslie Chan from the <a href="http://blog.utsc.utoronto.ca/idsprogram/">Centre for Critical Development Studies at the University of Toronto Scarborough (Canada)</a>, and supported by <a href="http://ocsdnet.org/team">an international panel of expert advisors</a>. OCSDNet will mobilize and support researchers and practitioners from the Global South (Latin America, including Central America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, East,Central and South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa) selected through an initial competitive call for Concept Notes (no more than 3,000 words), followed by full proposal development and subsequent approval.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Successful authors or organizations of concept notes will be invited to attend a proposal development workshop to be held in Nairobi, Kenya, from Oct. 13-16, 2014.</strong>The cost of attendance and travel will be covered by the program. The purpose of the workshop will be to collectively review and refine the program‚Äôs objectives and conceptual framework, to identify common or synergistic research problems and shared methodologies, and to allow applicants to incorporate relevant knowledge from the program team and advisory board members in preparation of the full case study proposals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The call will be closed on <strong>Monday, September 8th, 2014.</strong> Late submissions will not be considered.</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">Eligibility Criteria</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The call is open to any researcher or practitioner affiliated with an organization or consortium of organizations based in countries eligible for support by the IDRC (see a list of eligible countries <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/EN/AboutUs/WhatWeDo/Pages/CountryProfileList.aspx">here</a>).</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the time of submission, applicants must indicate their availability and commitment to participate in the proposal development workshop to be held in Nairobi on October 13-16, 2014. In case of unavailability, the applicant must be represented at the workshop by a colleague or collaborator who will play a significant role in the proposed project. Any Concept Notes that are not represented at the workshop will be disqualified from final proposal submission/consideration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Effort will be made to ensure that an equal number of projects will be selected from each of the supported regions (Latin America, Middle East and North Africa, Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa). The exact number of grants awarded will be determined by the quality of applications received and the cumulative cost of each proposal. Depending on the number of successful full proposals and the remaining funds, a second call may be issued at a later date.</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">Amount of Funding and Duration:</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Up to 15 projects will be funded, which may include field research, capacity building initiatives including implementation and experiments, and critical analysis of OCS. Grants will range between CAD $50,000 to CAD $80,000. Project duration must not exceed 24 months, including all research and/or implementation activities and final reporting. Projects are expected to begin in January 2015 and end by Dec. 2016.</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">OCSDNet support</h4>
<p dir="ltr">OCSDNet will work closely with the successful applicants to provide them with the support needed to further define the scope of research, effective implementation of the research agenda, and monitoring of the research outcomes throughout the grant period. In addition, the panel of international advisors will serve as mentors and support the selected research teams in terms of research design, data collection and analysis, and effective knowledge dissemination strategies. The OCSDNet virtual hub will further support resource sharing and the cross-fertilization of ideas and knowledge between research teams. OCSDNet will also support regional workshops, preparation for presentations and publications of research findings at appropriate international meetings and open access venues, and policy interface with funders and decision makers wherever applicable.</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">Evaluation Criteria</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Concept note submissions may incorporate both theoretical work and practical implementation relating to the conceptual framework and should clearly factor in development related outcomes. Final selection will also take into consideration our aims of supporting research and knowledge-sharing:</p>

The selection of case studies will be guided by a hybrid framework derived from the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework (developed by Ostrom and colleagues) with integrated theories and models from related areas of openness studies, including Open Source, Open Access, Open Educational Resources, Open Data and Open Innovation. This integrated framework will serve as a ‚ÄúTheory of Change‚Äù (ToC) that guides the design and development of the network and subsequent development of an evaluation framework for the sub-projects and overall effectiveness of the network. Through the IAD framework, we will highlight the enabling environment and institutions and begin to address policy challenges in the various contexts. <i>The goal will not be simply to document, but also to take a critical approach to examining the embedded assumptions behind various models of open collaboration and theories of change.</i>One key assumption is that OCS is a complex socio-technological system and not simply a collection of mechanisms. <i>Attention will also be given to unintended outcomes and potentially negative impacts brought about by open practices and network designs.</i> <strong>The key components of the research program:</strong>

In particular, OCSDNet aims to:
<ol>
	<li>Support new projects and activities so as to generate evidence on whether, and if so, under what conditions open approaches to science can enable research that contributes to development goals in the global South.</li>
	<li>Build a community of Open Science practitioners and leaders in different contexts, by nurturing an interactive research network.</li>
	<li>Identify the structural, technical, policy and cultural barriers for individuals and organizations to participate in OCS and determine how these barriers could be addressed.</li>
	<li>Contribute to the building of a new and vibrant area of study (Open and Collaborative Science in Development), producing knowledge to inform policy and practice, and a community of researchers who identify themselves as working on OCS.</li>
</ol>
In particular, <i>a key area of focus is whether openness will provide added insights into the role of science, technology, and innovation (STI) in development practices and theorizing, with the ultimate goal of strengthening local research capacity and informing policy-making and practice.</i> Research supported by this project will allow the gathering of observations on whether, and if so, the conditions under which open approaches to research and collaboration could lead to various development outcomes in the Global South. <strong>This network project is particularly timely given the increasing awareness of the integral role of science, technology and innovation (STI) in development activities on the one hand, and the growing interest in the role of openness in science as a transformative tool for both development thinking and practices on the other.</strong>";s:10:"post_title";s:13:"OCSDNet Goals";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:13:"ocsdnet-goals";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-10-14 20:54:56";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-10-14 20:54:56";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:2:"34";s:4:"guid";s:36:"http://cbox.ocsdnet.org/?page_id=122";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"2";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:5;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"106";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"2";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2014-10-09 14:00:25";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2014-10-09 14:00:25";s:12:"post_content";s:0:"";s:10:"post_title";s:8:"The Team";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:8:"the-team";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-10-11 16:32:06";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-10-11 16:32:06";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:2:"34";s:4:"guid";s:36:"http://cbox.ocsdnet.org/?page_id=106";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:6;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:2:"97";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"1";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2014-10-09 12:19:01";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2014-10-09 12:19:01";s:12:"post_content";s:42:"[ess_grid alias="masonryblog_jimmycarter"]";s:10:"post_title";s:4:"BLOG";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:4:"blog";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-12-05 09:11:04";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-12-05 09:11:04";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"http://cbox.ocsdnet.org/?page_id=97";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:7;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:2:"67";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"2";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2014-10-08 14:27:01";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2014-10-08 14:27:01";s:12:"post_content";s:5268:"Details of the Institutional Analysis and Development Framework

The IAD framework was originally conceived in the 1980s by Elinor Ostrom, Nobel Prize winner in economics in 2009, to study commons pool resources and their governance by communities without state intervention. The framework has been continually refined by Ostrom and other scholars over the last three decades (Ostrom 1985 and the details of the framework here). Ostrom‚Äôs work challenged the conventional wisdom about the need for government regulation of public resources in order to attain sustainability and benefit sharing (Ostrom, 1990, 2005). The IAD framework (see Fig. 6) has been applied to a variety of studies on how people collaborate and organize themselves across organizational and state boundaries to manage common resources such as forests and fisheries, which often cross or flow through national boundaries. Of particular relevance is that the framework has also been applied to knowledge as a commons, which also cross-cuts national boundaries, and hence is particularly relevant for our purpose (Hess and Ostrom, 2006; Hess 2006).

&nbsp;

Fig. 6. ¬†Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) Framework (from Ostrom, 2005)

&nbsp;

This framework is particularly suited for our purpose for a number of added reasons:

&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>i) ¬†The framework was originally designed for the analysis of the dynamics of institutions and their formation. This is particularly relevant given how peer production enabled by open networks and open practices is challenging existing practices and institutions and creating new and dynamic commons pool resources that are often ‚Äúinformal‚Äù before becoming ‚Äúinstitutionalized‚Äù or formalized. ¬†How OCS initiatives move from informal spaces to formal institutional structures could be an important area for investigation. This is also related to the theme of reward, recognition and incentive structure.</li>
	<li>ii) As Hess (2005:3) noted, the IAD is particularly suited for comparative analysis of this question: ‚ÄúHow do fallible humans come together, create communities and organizations, and make decisions and rules in order to sustain a resource or achieve a desired outcome?‚Äù. Since a key research theme of the network is the formation of a community of open science practitioners in different contexts, the analytical tools provided by IAD may prove to be particularly helpful.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

iii) ¬†Of notable importance is that the IAD framework pays prominent attention to the actors in their institutional contexts. This is key as some of the current definitions of open science (including ones discussed earlier) and some of the theories of change that have been proposed for openness and development (see Powell <i>et al</i>., 2013) do not take into account the role of the actors and their agency in bringing about different outcomes (Klein, 2010). The enabling mechanisms are often regarded as autonomous agents acting with independent rules that are unchanged. The IAD framework provides guidelines on understanding the rules and norms, both formal and informal, that members of a community observe, reject or modify. This aspect of the framework will be particularly helpful when it comes to looking at the motivation of participation or non-participation in open initiatives, and how openness itself should be seen as a dynamic or situational phenomenon.

&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>iv) The IAD provides a checklist of variables (e.g. actors, norms, institutional settings, research strategies, incentive structures, policies, etc.) that researchers should keep in mind in their research process, while providing a framework that structures the variables into a relational schema. The checklist will aid in the call for concept notes and the screening of case studies for common variables. This will further facilitate the synthesis of lessons from across case studies and the identification of cross-cutting themes in the regular evaluation process.</li>
	<li>v) While the broad schema of the IAD framework (Fig. 6, above) appears simple, it could get rather complicated when each of the components (e.g. Attributes of the community, Action Situation) are further revealed. This is another strength of the framework as it is highly flexible and allows complexity to be revealed in a step-by-step process.</li>

The full formulation of the conceptual framework for this project will follow a similar path, starting with a relatively simple framing based on the four broad themes identified from the two multidisciplinary agenda-setting workshops (see below), and proceeding with refinement of the framework as lessons and insights from the case studies begin to emerge.

&nbsp;

At the same time, key lessons, theories, and models from related areas of research, particularly in Open Source Software, ICT4D, Open Data, and Open Innovation will be integrated into the framework to strengthen its theoretical foundation and richness. As such, the framework will be a key output of the project, as it will have general analytical and explanatory utility that is relevant to cognate programs or fields.

<h4 style="text-align: center;">THEME 1 (T1): MOTIVATIONS (INCENTIVES AND IDEOLOGIES)</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;">This research theme investigates on a broad scale the contexts and conditions under which Open Science approaches are likely to be adopted by researchers and how a pro-open environment might be created at the social, cultural and policy framework levels. Unpacking these two problems requires an understanding of relevant actors, their behaviours and interactions at multiple levels and often across disparate research networks as well as more bounded organizations. The objective is to further understand and develop strategies to overcome some of the challenges to the uptake of Open Science. For this reason, it will intersect heavily with research theme three, investigating Open Science communities, and four, examining evidence for the proposed benefits of Open Science.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">THEME 2 (T2): INFRASTRUCTURES &amp; TECHNOLOGIES</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;">Open and Collaborative Science is highly dependent on network technologies. We are seeing an increase in global connectivity enabled by technologies such as mobile phones, including web-enabled smartphones, high-bandwidth Internet connections and a broader ecosystem of scientific data, resources and cloud-based services. Such technologies are assumed to be enablers of OCS, increasing broad participation and practices. However, inequities in connectivity and access to the technologies required to participate in OCS are a challenge to its uptake and success. This research theme examines the infrastructure that enables or disables OCS, for whom and in what conditions.</p>
[/color-box]

[color-box color="theme3"]
<h4 style="text-align: center;">THEME 3 (T3): COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE IN OPEN AND COLLABORATIVE SCIENCE</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;">This theme speaks to the overarching question, ‚Äúhow can science be made more open and inclusive,‚Äù by looking at the communities of practitioners and stakeholders who shape the landscape of Open and Collaborative Science in Development (OCSD), and may influence the uptake and trajectory of OCSD approaches. Understanding more about communities of actors, the institutional contexts, their heterogeneities and interactions is particularly important to increase inclusiveness and inform other research themes around motivations and incentives.</p>
[/color-box]

[color-box color="theme4"]
<h4 style="text-align: center;">THEME 4 (T4): POTENTIAL IMPACTS (POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE) OF OPEN AND COLLABORATIVE SCIENCE</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;">The aim of this research theme is to systematically work through the proposed benefits for OCSD and find evidence to support them, as well as identifying and evidencing any risks and potential negative impacts. This will be challenging while the Open Science community is small and until their status as an object of study develops. Therefore, developing a conceptual framework and set of research methodologies is a vital part of ensuring that research is effective even at such an early stage. Research under this theme could combine observational studies with action research and support for Open Science practitioners as well as community building and awareness raising activities to increase uptake and participation in OCS4D in the global South. Methodologies drawing on evidence from other related but more advanced fields could also be applied to expand the scope of what is possible. All research under this theme focuses on the quality, meaningfulness and possible utility of openness and collaboration which dominate discussion in Open Development, Open Data and other topics, including other research networks under IDRC‚Äôs Information and Networks (I&amp;N) programme.</p>

<h2>OPEN AND COLLABORATIVE SCIENCE (OCS)</h2>
</div>
<div class="article-content">

<i>If we take as a starting assumption that Open Science entails collaboration and participation of diverse actors in a wide variety of institutional contexts, with widely different motivations, values and intentions,</i> then we must view Open Science as a conditional process operating within a highly complex socio-technical system. Thus, understanding the principles and dynamics of collaboration and participation should also be central to the proposed network activities. <b>We adopted ‚ÄúOpen and Collaborative Science‚Äù (OCS) as an operating term for the research network to remind us of the central nature of network collaboration.</b>

In Open Science, not only are research articles openly accessible, but access is also extended to other research objects such as data, software codes, protocols and workflows, such that people are free to use, re-use and distribute without legal, technological or social restrictions. ¬†In some cases, Open Science also entails the opening up of the entire research process from agenda-setting, data generation and data analysis, to dissemination and use with the aid of various emerging social platforms and tools.

Open Science utilizes the prevalence of the Internet and associated digital tools to enable greater local and global research collaboration. Such collaboration need not be limited to traditional research communities, but could also include the participation of citizen scientists, both in partnership with traditional research institutions as well as those in non-traditional research locations, often using open software, hardware and other open technologies.

<strong>The notion of OCS is an umbrella term that encompasses a diversity of activities, actors, assumptions, motivations, and institutional contexts and the outcomes of these complex socio-technical interactions are often uncertain. <i>OCS‚Äô outcomes may also turn out to be negative in nature, and could further exacerbate problems of inequitable participation, gender disparity, and further exclusion of researchers who do not have the capacity to take advantage of the network tools and resources.</i></strong>
<h3>Open and Collaborative Science (OCS) in the Global South/Developing Countries:</h3>
Rather than wasting resources in mimicking scientific establishments and policies of the pre-digital age, policy makers in developing countries should leverage networks by creating incentives for scientists to focus on research that addresses their concerns, and by finding ways to tie knowledge to local problem solving.

This approach is highly appropriate because many of the ‚Äúgrand‚Äù challenges facing humanities today, such as climate change impacts, environmental degradation, emerging infectious diseases, inadequate access to clean drinking water and food insecurity are global in nature but disproportionately hurt developing economies. Meeting these challenges requires not only appropriate local solutions but also requires rapid and sustainable deployment of new tools and approaches that draw from the global scientific and knowledge commons.

In addition to addressing these global level problems, which require long term interventions, OCS also promises to increase visibility and impact of research at the local level, facilitate participation of researchers in local and international collaborations, encourage public engagement with science through activities such as citizen science, and promote the culture of knowledge sharing and new thinking on social innovations. These are seen to be short term outcomes that have direct development benefits and could contribute to the strengthening of local research capacity through education and participation

While Open and Collaborative Science is lauded by many as a guiding principle, the practice is far from universal in the Global North, and awareness of its benefits and practices are even less prominent in the Global South.And while many of the purported development benefits of Open and Collaborative Science are highly attractive, there is little empirical evidence at the moment to support or refute these claims.

We have very limited understanding of the social, political and institutional contexts and the value framework within which open approaches to science take place, and equally little about the mechanisms that link Open Science practices with potential development outcomes.

<strong><i>The proposed research program and network is designed to address these gaps in our understanding through a multi-stage data collection and theory building process.</i></strong>
